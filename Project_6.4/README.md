# Introduction  
Project for MAE259B, a simulation for card spring process based on MATLAB.  

# Difference  
Codes in `/project_beam` are written for ejection with no angle.  
Codes in `project_rot` are written for ejection with given angle.  

# How to run
For `project_beam', Run `Phase1.m`, `Phase2.m`, `Phase3.m` in sequence, and then Run `multi_plot.m` to generate the video.  
For `project_rot`, Run `Phase1_rot.m`, `Phase2_rot.m`, `Phase3.m`,in sequence, and then Run `multi_plot.m` to generate the video.
